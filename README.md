# K-means and DBSCAN

The second homework for the introduction to data mining course on implementing the K-means algorithm and DBSCAN.

## K-means++
A2_G13_t1.java

## Getting Started

You need JDK 11 to run the application.

[//]: # (These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.)

### Prerequisites

[//]: # (What things you need to install the software and how to install them)

[//]: # (```)

[//]: # (Give examples)

[//]: # (```)

### Installing

[//]: # (A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Say what the step will be)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (```)

[//]: # (Give the example)

[//]: # (```)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (And repeat)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (```)

[//]: # (until finished)

[//]: # (```)

[//]: # (End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo)

## Running the tests

[//]: # (Explain how to run the automated tests for this system)

### DBSCAN

There are 2 possible options to run this.

#### Normal Running

From the `/experiments`, run this command with your specified parameters.

```bash
sh run.sh <your-specified-command>
```

e.g. `sh run.sh ../resources/artd-31.csv`

Then the program will output the ones described in the assignment manual.

#### Experiment

From the `/experiments`, run this command:

```bash
sh runExp.sh
```

Then the program will output the ones that yield the table in the report.


### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
